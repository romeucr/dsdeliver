# DS Delivery

## About
This project is built with Java(backend), Typescript/ReactJS(frontend) and Typescript/React Native(mobile) during the second edition of the DevSuperior's Week, event organized by [DevSuperior](https://devsuperior.com.br).

The frontend-web is the page where you can order some food, informing your addresss where it will be delivered.
The frontend-mobile is to be used by the person that will do the delivery. It shows all pending orders and the person can check the order's details and confirm the delivery.
